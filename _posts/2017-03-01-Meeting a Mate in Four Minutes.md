title: Meeting a Mate in Four Minutes
---


This project aims to draw conclusions from speed dating data collected at Columbia University and build a model to predict whether two participants will match.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, comes as a single table.  I designed and created an SQLite database to segment the data into a more useful and malleable structure.  Using this database I explored the difference in correlation with participantsâ€™ decisions to pursue a second date, whether placing limitations on how many match decisions were allowed affected males and females differently, how a participants number of matches vary with self-rated attractiveness and partner rated attractiveness and how 'yes' decisions trend with the sequential order of a date throughout the event.

## Evaluating a Logistic Regression model against the baseline

After creating the database I implemented a logistic regression model to predict a participants' decision.  To test my model I first built a baseline model which randomly guessed whether a participant's partner would give a 'yes' decision.  Random guessing produces an accuracy 50%.


```python
random_match_predictions = []
for i in range(len(speed_data)):
    random_match_predictions.append(randint(0,1))

print("Random Guess Accuracy: " + str(accuracy_score(speed_data['match'],random_match_predictions)))
```

    Random Guess Accuracy: 0.495464311291


It turns out that the decision made by a participant's partner could be predicted well above the baseline with just a single feature - how attractive the partner rated the participant.  Adding other features to this model only marginally increased performance, and in some cases detracted from the model's accuracy.  This simple logistic regression predicts matches with roughly 83% accuracy.

Since there was so much predictive power in the attractiveness attribute I performed further analysis based on the attractiveness attribute within the dataset.  Those results will be discussed later on.


```python
lr_data = speed_data.dropna(axis=0,subset=['attr_o'])
features = ['attr_o']
model = LogisticRegression()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(lr_data[features], lr_data['match'],test_size = 0.3)
model.fit(X_train,y_train)
model.score(X_test,y_test)
```




    Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.832



## Does the order of when you meet your partner of a have an impact on their decision?

Before diving into a deep analysis of what influences participants, I wanted to establish whether simply the order of a date during the event had an influence on their 'yes' decisions.

Related research on sequential decision-making from the University of Negev in Israel shows that when judges are presiding in court they are far more lenient at the beginning of the day, and likewise after taking a break.  The study observed 8 parole judges and included over 1000 rulings over the course of 50 Days.

"They found that at the beginning of a court session about 65 percent of the rulings tended to be in favour of the prisoner, but the chance of a favourable ruling declined to near zero by the end of the session" - theglobeandmail.com

I suspected speed-dating participants might exhibit similar behavior, so I graphed their decisions over the course of the event.


```python
aggregated_order = pd.pivot_table(speed_data,values='dec_o',columns='order',aggfunc='mean')
#aggregated_order.to_csv('order_of_date_data.csv')
sns.set_style('dark',{'axes.grid' : False})
aggregated_order.plot()
plt.xticks(range(len(aggregated_order)))
plt.title('Mean of Yes Decisions vs Order of Date')
plt.ylabel('Mean of Yes Decisions')
plt.xlabel('Date Sequence Number')
plt.show()
```

The advantage of being someone's first date is apparent from this graph, however it is difficult to conclude what effect the mid-event break is having, if any.  To explore this further I separated dates into several buckets based on their order: first/last, immediately before the break, and immediately after the break.

Speed dating behavior turned out to be a bit different compared to parole rulings. As seen below it seems that a date immediately before the break is slightly more advantageous than immediately after.  The advantage to being someone's first or last date is also confirmed.


```python
plt.figure(1,figsize=(15,5))

plt.subplot(131)
first_or_last_pivot.plot(kind='bar')
plt.ylim([0.38,0.48])
plt.xlabel("")
plt.ylabel("Percentage of Yes Decisions")
labels = ['Middle Dates','First Or Last Dates']
plt.xticks(range(2), labels, rotation='horizontal')

plt.ylim([0.38,0.48])

plt.ylabel("Percentage of Yes Decisions")
labels = ['Other Middle Dates','Date After Break']
plt.xticks(range(2), labels, rotation='horizontal')

plt.ylim([0.38,0.48])

plt.xlabel("")
plt.ylabel("Percentage of Yes Decisions")
labels = ['Other Middle Dates','Date Before Break']
plt.xticks(range(2), labels, rotation='horizontal')

## Observed differences in attribute importance under limitations
*See Appendix A for dataframe construction and manipulation

During the speed dating study there were two scenarios a speed-date event could fall under.  In scenario 1 participants were able to give a 'yes' decision to as many dates as they wanted.  In scenario 2 participants were limited to only giving a 'yes' response to only half of their partners.

I wanted to determine how a participant's attribute ratings would vary with their decision on a partner when there were constraints placed on their 'yes' responses.

I looked at how well the ratings of attractiveness, intelligence and fun correlated with a participant's decision for both scenarios and also segmented the results by gender.  The result was rather striking.  

Female decisions correlated less with each attribute as their 'yes' decisions were limited.  This might suggest that as a woman's options expand they become more selective for attractiveness, fun and intelligence, however, as their options become limited they place greater consideration on other factors.


```python
sns.set_style('dark',{'axes.grid' : True})
extensive_female_dec_corrmat.head(1).iloc[:,1:].plot(kind='bar',rot=0)
extensive_female_dec_corrmat.head(1).iloc[:,1:].to_csv('extended female decision corrmat.csv')

plt.title('Female Decision Correlation with Limited Choice')
plt.ylim([0.15,0.5])
plt.show()

## Men's Inverse Reaction to Limitation

The unexpected finding here was that men exhibited the exact opposite behavior when limiting their number of 'yes' decisions.  As their options became limited, they were more responsive to partners they perceived to be more attractive, intelligent and fun.  The greatest disparity in attribute correlation between limited and extensive choice is the jump in how men's rating of how fun they perceive their partner affected their 'yes' decisions.

## Observed differences in match results based on self-rated attractiveness

Since attractiveness seemed to be a rather accurate predictor of whether participants give a 'yes' decision, I wanted to explore the relationship between people's rating of their own attractiveness and the matches they receive.

I grouped participants using KMeans clustering based on how highly they rated their own attractiveness the night of the event.  I performed the classification using both 5 and 8 clusters, with similar findings.  

The results for 5 clusters gave three groups who rate their attractiveness between a 5 and 7 with two outlier groups, those who rated themselves extremely high - averaging over 9 - and extremely low - averaging 3.5.

On the aggregate those who rate themselves extremely high do in fact receive more matches than those who rate themselves extremely low in attractiveness, but not by much.  This begged a follow-up question, though. Do results for high self-rated attractive males differ from the same group of females?  This breakdown revealed a dramatic separation.

Match results were much different when looking at these groups broken out by gender.  Men who rated themselves highly attractive did tend to do significantly better than their low self-rating counterparts.  The disparity is nearly 2 matches on average.  Even the next highest group receives almost a full match less.

The same breakdown for females, however, tells a much different story.  The difference in average number of matches between those who rated themselves highest versus those who rated themselves lowest was only 0.2.  Both groups receive roughly the same number of matches.  Even more profound is that the group rating themselves the highest don't even receive the most matches, in fact all the female groups that rate themselves more conservatively received more matches than those who rated themselves the highest!  Interesting.


```python
self_rated_five_class_pivot
#Gender 0 represents females, 1 represents males
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>self-rated attractiveness at sign-up</th>
      <td>5.7</td>
      <td>9.1</td>
      <td>3.4</td>
      <td>7.0</td>
      <td>8.0</td>
      <td>5.6</td>
      <td>9.4</td>
      <td>3.6</td>
      <td>7.0</td>
      <td>8.0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Observed differences in match results based on partner-rated attractiveness

The above results were rather striking, so I wanted to see if they would be repeated when grouping participants based on how their partners rated their attractiveness.  This time the clustering was performed based on the average attractiveness rating a participant received from their partners, not themselves.  The outcome supported the results of the earlier logistic regression.

Using the partner's rating as the clustering feature participants, for both genders, who were rated as more attractive literally outmatch their peers, and in order nonetheless.  The disparity between number of matches, however, is far greater between highest vs lowest rated males than it is for the same groups in females


```python
partner_rated_five_class_pivot
#Gender 0 represents females, 1 represents males
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>gender</th>
      <th colspan="5" halign="center">0</th>
      <th colspan="5" halign="center">1</th>

      <th>0</th>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th>4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>number of matches</th>
      <td>2.2</td>
      <td>1.4</td>
      <td>3.5</td>
      <td>1.7</td>
      <td>3.8</td>

      <td>0.9</td>

      <td>6.2</td>

      <td>5.2</td>
      <td>7.9</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Building a Better Model

After exploring the ins and outs of how attractiveness impacts out participants the next goal was to build a model that takes all attribute ratings into account to predict the outcome of the speed date.

For this a Random Forest classifier was used, and to find the optimal parameters I performed a gridsearch on the model.


```python
rfc = RandomForestClassifier()
features = ['condtn', 'Male Age', 'round','Female Age','F rating of partner attractiveness','M rating of partner attractiveness', 'F rating of partner fun','M rating of partner fun', 'F rating of partner intelligence','M rating of partner intelligence', 'F rating of partner sincerity','M rating of partner sincerity', 'F rating of partner shared interests','M rating of partner shared interests', 'F rating of partner ambition','M rating of partner ambition', 'order','age_difference']
X = dates[features]
y = dates['match']
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100,200,500],#, 200, 500],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2'],
    'max_depth': [10,20,100,None]
}
CV_rfc = GridSearchCV(estimator=rfc, param_grid=param_grid, cv= 5)
CV_rfc.fit(X, y)
print(CV_rfc.best_params_)
print(CV_rfc.best_score_)
```

    {'n_estimators': 50, 'max_depth': 20, 'max_features': 'sqrt'}
    Random Forest Match Prediction Accuracy: 0.85


The Random Forest model taking into account all attributes and a few other features about the date scored nearly 85.1%.  A marginal gain over the Logistic Regression at a significant cost increase in computing power and analyst effort.


```python
feature_importance_dictionary = {}
for index, i in enumerate(features):
    feature_importance_dictionary[i] = CV_rfc.best_estimator_.feature_importances_[index]

feature_importance_dictionary
x =sorted(feature_importance_dictionary.items(), key=lambda x: x[1],reverse=True)
#print(x)

feature_importance_list = []
feature_importance_labels = []
for i in x:
    feature_importance_list.append(i[1])
    feature_importance_labels.append(i[0])

plt.bar(range(len(feature_importance_list)), feature_importance_list, align='center')
plt.xticks(range(len(feature_importance_labels)), feature_importance_labels,rotation=90)
plt.ylabel('Feature Importance')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


<img src="/images/Meeting a Mate in Four Minutes_files/Meeting a Mate in Four Minutes_28_0.png" class="fit image">


After seeing what features were most important in a match, I was curious what factors impact the decisions of male vs. female participants.  Again using a Random Forest, we find that men are most swayed by how attractive they perceive their partner, while females are a bit more balanced between how attractive and fun they rate their partners as well as how they rate their shared interests.  As with predicting matches, we find that the accuracy for predicting decisions does not significantly improve over the Logistic Regression.


```python
rfc = RandomForestClassifier()
features = ['condtn', 'Male Age', 'round','Female Age','F rating of partner attractiveness','M rating of partner attractiveness', 'F rating of partner fun','M rating of partner fun', 'F rating of partner intelligence','M rating of partner intelligence', 'F rating of partner sincerity','M rating of partner sincerity', 'F rating of partner shared interests','M rating of partner shared interests', 'F rating of partner ambition','M rating of partner ambition', 'order','age_difference']
X = dates[features]
y = dates['Male Decision']
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100,200,500],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2'],
    'max_depth': [10,20,100,None]
}
CV_rfc = GridSearchCV(estimator=rfc, param_grid=param_grid, cv= 5)
CV_rfc.fit(X, y)
print(CV_rfc.best_params_)
print(CV_rfc.best_score_)

feature_importance_dictionary = {}
for index, i in enumerate(features):
    feature_importance_dictionary[i] = CV_rfc.best_estimator_.feature_importances_[index]

feature_importance_dictionary
x =sorted(feature_importance_dictionary.items(), key=lambda x: x[1],reverse=True)
#print(x)

## Conclusions

In conclusion, it's neither surprising nor uplifting that the outcome of a four minute date hinges largely on how attractive both parties perceive the other to be.  While other factors can weigh in, they hardly affect a person's decision to pursue a second date.

However, this study suggests some interesting findings. Frist is that when going through a sequence of dates, it is far more likely that you match with those you meet early on.  Another is that decision factors vary when choices are restricted.  As a male limitations tend work in your favor if your counterparty doesn't find you all that attractive or fun because the bar has been lowered.  As a speed-dating female, however, you might find that having more competition actually works in your favor!

It's been said many times that we're terrible judges of ourselves, and that sentiment is echoed in the world of speed-dating.  Given that performance in speed dating is based on matching, men seem to self-rank somewhat well where women do an abysmal job of it.
